# CS 046B Introduction to Data Structures

These are some homework and lab assignments I've worked on for CS 046B Introduction to Data Structures at SJSU for the fall 2019 semester. I may also add other code I've written for this class besides lab and homework assignments. I hope you find it helpful! Please feel free to let me know what you think.
